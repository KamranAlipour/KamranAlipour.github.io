title: "A study on multimodal and interactive explanations for visual question answering"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2020-multimodal
excerpt: 'This paper evaluates multimodal explanations in the setting of a Visual Question Answering (VQA) task, by asking users to predict the response accuracy of a VQA agent with and without explanations. We use between-subjects and within-subjects experiments to probe explanation effectiveness in terms of improving user prediction accuracy, confidence, and reliance, among other factors.'
