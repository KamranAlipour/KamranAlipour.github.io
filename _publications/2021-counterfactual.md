title: "Improving users' mental model with attention‐directed counterfactual edits"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2021-counterfactual
excerpt: "In the domain of visual question answering (VQA), studies have shown improvement in users' mental model of the VQA system when they are exposed to examples of how these systems answer certain image‐question (IQ) pairs. In this work, we show that showing controlled counterfactual IQ examples are more effective at improving the mental model of users as compared to simply showing random examples. We compare a generative approach and a retrieval‐based approach to show counterfactual examples. We use recent advances in generative adversarial networks to generate counterfactual images by deleting and inpainting certain regions of interest in the image."
