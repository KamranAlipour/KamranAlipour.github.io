<div style="text-align: justify">
I am a senior AI R&D engineer with expertise in developing and deploying machine learning models for computer vision and natural language processing applications. I have extensive experience in explainable AI (XAI) methods and have worked on developing XAI techniques that enhance trust and transparency in human-machine interactions. I am currently spearheading the development of the next generation of AI-based recommendation systems for Williams Sonoma, leveraging cutting-edge deep learning algorithms to deliver highly interpretable recommendations that can be easily understood and explained by end-users.
