<div style="text-align: right">
I'm a Ph.D. candidate in computer science at UC San Diego. My research is focused on developing and evaluating explainable AI (XAI) for computer vision and natural language processing(NLP). I've specifically worked on XAI methods that can make AI more interpretable in various applications such as visual question answering (VQA) and medical imaging. During my research, I've investigated the impact of explanations on users' trust in AI and evaluated the efficacy of different explanation methods in providing transparency to human-machine interactions.
