Work experience
======
* __Outward Inc.__ Aug 2022 - Present:<br /> 
  ___Senior AI R&D Engineer___
  * Developing and implementing deep learning recommendation systems that can design and furnish rooms using transformer-based graph neural networks, which provide comprehensive explanations for their design choices.

* __Outward Inc.__ Summer 2020 & 2021:<br /> 
  ___Intern AI R&D Engineer___
  * Developing algorithms for 3D scene understanding and depth estimation from single RGB images for advanced object and texture manipulation.

* __CureMetrix Co.__ Summer 2017:<br />
  ___Data Science Intern___
  * Specializing in research and development of transformation techniques for efficient processing of 3D MRI images to improve breast cancer detection and prediction using AI algorithms.

Research experience
======
__SRI International (DARPA Grant):__
 * Conducting research on multimodal explanations for vision and language tasks, and developing metrics to evaluate AI algorithm trust and competency.

__Shiley Eye Institute, UCSD Health (NIH Grant):__
 * Detecting glaucoma from fundus photographs transformers. The introduced transformer based classifier proved higher accuracy and interpretability compared to its CNN counterpart.

__Jokerst Bioimaging Lab, UCSD (NIH Grant):__
 * Contrast enhancement in low-fluence photoacoustic images with semi-supervised deep learning algorithms.
