Education
======
* B.S. in Aerospace Engineering, K.N. Toosi University of Technology, 2011
* M.S. in Aerospace Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, 2013
* Ph.D in Computer Science, University of California San Diego, 2022 (expected)

Research experience
======
__Explainability in vision/language AI:__
 * Efficacy evaluation of explanation modalities in vision and language tasks and quantitative analysis of trust in AI algorithms. This project introduces new metrics and methods to produce, and evaluate the helpfulness of explanations.
 * Uncertainty prediction, calibration, and explanation in deep neural networks__Training uncertainty-aware AI algorithms and explaining their uncertainty with non-adversarial counterfactuals. 

__AI in medical imaging:__
 * Detecting glaucoma from fundus photographs transformers. The introduced transformer based classifier proved higher accuracy and interpretability compared to its CNN counterpart.  
 * Contrast enhancement in low-fluence photoacoustic images with semi-supervised deep learning algorithms.
